# Riemann_Series_Rearrangement
Convergence of a conditionally convergent series.

### Sequence
*A sequence is a list of things (usually numbers, functions, etc. ) that are in order.<br>
When the sequence goes on forever it is called an infinite sequence otherwise finite sequence.*

### Series
*A series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence of numbers. <br>
More precisely, an infinite sequence {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, …..} defines a series S that is denoted by* <br>

*where a<sub>k</sub> is the kth term of the series.*

### nth Partial Sum
*Sum of the first “n” terms of the series is known as the nth partial sum and is denoted by* <br>

### Convergent and Divergent Series
*An infinite series is said to be converging if* \

*"L" must be finite and unique real number. Any series that is not convergent is said to be divergent.*

### Absolutely Convergent Series
*If the series* <br>

*converges, then the series* <br>

*is absolutely convergent.*

### Conditionally Convergent Series
*If the series* <br>

*converges, but the series* <br>

*diverges, then the series* <br>

*is conditionally convergent.*

## Riemann Rearrangement Theorem
**Riemann rearrangement theorem**, says that if an infinite series of real numbers is conditionally convergent, <br>
then its terms can be arranged in a permutation so that the new series converges to an arbitrary real number, or diverges. <br>

### Statement of the Theorem
Suppose that <br>

is conditionally convergent. Let M be a real number. Then there exists a permutation σ such that <br>

There also exists a permutation σ such that <br>

The sum can also be rearranged to diverge to -∞ or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite.
